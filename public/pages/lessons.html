          LUAU, the programming language used in Roblox, has variables which are stored pieces of memory.
          <br>
          <br>
          You can think of a variable as a name given to a value you want to store. If you wanted to store the number 10 and you wanted to name the variable ten, you would simply write 
          <br>
          <b style="background-color: yellow;">local ten = 10</b>
          <br>
          The "local" keyword indicates that the variable is a local variable which allows for extremely fast access and will be explained in later chapters.
          <br>
          <br>
          Variables in LUAU do not have types, rather values have types. A type can simply be explained as what kind of memory you want to store. There are many different types in LUAU which will be explored in the next few sections.
        </div>


        <div class="SectionTitle" id="1.2">1.2: Values</div>

        <div class="SectionParagraph">
          LUAU consists of many different Values, including Integers, Strings, and Booleans.
          <br>
          <br>
          Since different values are needed to store different types of data, the type of value used should be based on what type of data you are trying to store.
          <br>
          <br>
          The next few sections will discuss the different types of basic values that exist in LUAU.
        </div>

        <div class="SectionTitle" id="1.3">1.3: Integers</div>

        <div class="SectionParagraph">
          Integers are used to describe data in the form of numbers. Integers are especially useful because they can be used with many mathematical methods in order to manipulate them.
          <br>
          <br>
          Integers can easily be stored in a variable by writing
          <br>
          <b style="background-color: yellow;">local ten = 10</b>
          <br>
          By writing the number "10" we indicate that the variable "ten" holds the number 10.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are many mathematical methods we can use with integers including, <b style="background-color: yellow;">"+", "-", "/", "*"</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Therfore we can easily manipulate a variable containing an integer value.
          <br>
          <b>
            local num = 10
            <br>
            num = num + 10 <b style="background-color: yellow;">-- Here we change the variable "num" to store the previous variable of "num" which was 10 and added 10 to it</b>
            <br>
            num = num - 10 <b style="background-color: yellow;">-- Here we change the variable "num" to store the previous variable of "num" which was 20 and subtracted 10 to it</b>
            <br>
            num = num/10 <b style="background-color: yellow;">-- Here we change the variable "num" to store the quotient of the previous value of "num" and 10</b>
            <br>
            num = num * 10 <b style="background-color: yellow;">-- Here we change the variable "num" to store the product of the previous value of "num" and 10</b>
            <br>
          </b>

          <br>

          Notice how we no longer use the keyword "local" after initializing the variable "num". This is because we only need to indicate the variable is a local variable in the beginning.
        </div>

        <div class="SectionTitle" id="1.4">1.4: Booleans</div>

        <div class="SectionParagraph">
          Boolean values are denoted as either being <b style="background-color: transparent;">true</b> or <b style="background-color: transparent;">false</b>.
          <br>
          <br>
          These values are particularly powerful when used in conditional statements which we will go over in later chapters.
          <br>
          <br>
          Boolean values can be written as:
          <br>
          <b style="background-color: yellow;">local Value = true</b>
          <br>
          where "Value" is the given name of the Variable and "true" indicates a true boolean value.
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, the keyword "not" is often used with booleans to indicate the opposite of a value. For example, if our variable "Value" is initially set to true as above and we write
          <br>
          <b style="background-color: yellow;">Value = not Value</b>
          <br>
          the variable "Value" would be given the opposite boolean value of "false".
        </div>

        <div class="SectionTitle" id="1.5">1.5: Strings</div>

        <div class="SectionParagraph">
          String values are denoted by including quotation marks around a group of characters. Strings are essentially a list of characters and are often used to store words.
